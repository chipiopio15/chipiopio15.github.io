        <h2 id="modal-cricket-title">Social Impact Report – Italian Cricket Federation</h2>

        <div class="project-details">
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>This project entailed the independent development of the first-ever Social Impact Report for the Italian Cricket Federation. I designed the reporting model from scratch, managing all phases—from strategic design to execution—while coordinating directly with all internal departments and external institutional stakeholders. The report aims to set a precedent for sustainability reporting in Italian sports federations, incorporating international ESG principles and tailored for the sports sector.</p>

          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <p>The model was grounded in the VSME framework and dual materiality principles, enriched by real-time stakeholder mapping and structured ESG data collection. I integrated GRI and SASB standards for compliance and comparability. To enhance scalability and automation, I developed and deployed AI agents through the N8N platform to assist with data structuring, report drafting, and stakeholder feedback analysis. The entire process was validated externally to ensure methodological rigor and institutional alignment.</p>

          <h3>Key Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 First certified social impact report in Italian cricket history</li>
            <li>2 Identification of 12 key ESG material topics</li>
            <li>3 Engagement of over 200 stakeholders at national and regional levels</li>
            <li>4 Approved 2024–2027 Sustainability Roadmap tailored to sports governance</li>
            <li>5 AI-driven automation model prototyped for replicable sustainability reporting in sports federations</li>

        <div class="project-details">
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>EduChampDC is an original university-led initiative designed to support and empower student-athletes navigating the challenges of dual careers. The program combines academic mentoring, athletic flexibility, and institutional advocacy to ensure that performance in sport does not come at the cost of education. Conceived within a broader Third Mission framework, EduChampDC aims to influence policy, foster social responsibility, and establish a replicable dual-career culture across academic institutions.</p>
          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <p>EduChampDC applies a multi-dimensional approach based on the integration of research, stakeholder training, and service design. The initiative leverages EU best practices (e.g., the "More Than Gold" model) to develop custom interventions tailored to the Italian university system. We organized structured interviews, co-design sessions with athletes and staff, and pilot-tested advisory formats. Training modules were co-created with both academic and sports professionals, focusing on time management, career planning, and identity balance. Peer mentoring, impact tracking, and longitudinal follow-up were incorporated to assess and refine support efficacy.</p>
          <h3>Key Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 30+ student-athletes actively involved across initial pilot phase</li>
            <li>2 Institutional endorsement by university sports committees and faculty departments</li>
            <li>3 First co-designed support toolkit launched for dual-career student-athletes</li>
            <li>4 Integration of findings into strategic plans for student well-being and retention</li>
            <li>5 Engagement of over 10 academic/sports entities including national federations and university staff</li>
            <li>6 Presented at 2 national university-sport conferences (2024–2025)</li>

        <div class="project-details">
          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>FutuRace Rome was a flagship university-led event merging high-performance electric motorsport with the themes of sustainable innovation, future mobility, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Set in the heart of Rome, the initiative was not just an exhibition—but a prototype for a new kind of academic-industry interface. My involvement focused on strategic communications, stakeholder engagement, and experiential design aimed at connecting students, institutions, and companies in a shared vision of technological progress.</p>
          <h3>Methodology</h3>
          <p>The project adopted a multi-tiered planning model, integrating digital storytelling, event branding, and real-time interaction strategies. I worked on aligning communication channels with the core values of the initiative: sustainability, inclusion, and innovation. Through continuous coordination with universities, municipal authorities, and Formula E partners, we crafted a narrative that resonated with both technical and general audiences.</p>

          <h3>Key Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>1 Over 20,000 attendees in 3 days, with 60% student participation</li>
            <li>2 Strategic partnerships with Formula E, ENEL X, and key mobility stakeholders</li>
            <li>3 Full digital media coverage and institutional visibility</li>
